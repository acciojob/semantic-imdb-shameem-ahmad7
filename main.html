                Inception is a science fiction movie directed by Christopher Nolan, which revolves around the concept of 
                entering dreams to plant ideas deep within someone's subconscious. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, 
                is a skilled thief and master of extracting secrets from people's minds while they dream. However, Cobb's 
                past begins to haunt him as he takes on his final mission â€” a dangerous task to perform an inception, 
                the planting of an idea rather than its extraction.
